        <p>I&rsquo;ve just finished teaching two back-to-back web development summer camps for high school students at the Flatiron School, and was recently hired as a full-time instructor for the upcoming <a href="https://after.flatironschool.com/">Flatiron after-school coding program</a>. I&rsquo;m incredibly excited to be back in the classroom, working with great students, a strong team, and interesting content. As such, I&rsquo;m going to pivot here for a while and post insights, best practices, and thoughts on teaching kids to code.</p>

<p>Today I&rsquo;d like to talk about teaching &ndash; and practicing &ndash; patience. It&rsquo;s one of those intangible soft-skills that you&rsquo;re automatically supposed to have as a teacher. We preach the virtues of patience in class on a daily basis. We are supposed to be able to sit with a student who &lsquo;isn&rsquo;t getting it&rsquo; for as long as it takes, until a concept clicks and suddenly everything is clear. Teachers are the epitome of patience, right?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, finding patience can be a struggle for me. After teaching a concept multiple times and then sitting with a student who still doesn&rsquo;t understand, I feel myself tense up and frustration rears its head. Why doesn&rsquo;t this student get it? However, when I pause and examine this frustration a little more, I realize that it is directed towards myself, and not the student. If the student isn&rsquo;t getting it, it&rsquo;s my fault for not teaching well enough, or for not planning for every type of learning situation. And I&rsquo;ll spiral down from frustration into despair: &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m just a terrible teacher. I&rsquo;m not doing this right.&rdquo;, etc.</p>

<p>But then I remember my own experience learning to code, and how difficult it was knowing that there was something there that I had to understand but unable to get the fog around the concept to clear. I had excellent teachers, but sometimes things took a while to sink in. And I realize that even if you have the best teacher in the world, some things just take time. You time need to digest. Concepts don&rsquo;t always come right away. You could have the most talented piano teacher alive sitting next to you teaching you a new song, but you&rsquo;re not going to be able to play that song right away. Practice, review, and drilling are key to learning.</p>

<p>Which makes me feel better about my teaching, and reminds me that I need not only be patient with my students, but also with myself. Like any endeavour, I&rsquo;m not going to be a great coding instructor on day one. My lessons aren&rsquo;t going to be perfect. There will be better ways to teach concepts that I&rsquo;ll discover as I move forward. The key point is that I&rsquo;m doing, and in doing I&rsquo;ll learn what works and what doesn&rsquo;t. And that, I hope, will make me a better teacher&hellip;</p>
